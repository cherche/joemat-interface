# joemat-interface

A MATLAB interface to the Joe-s-Special-Matrix-Calc library.

## Building

Navigate to the project directory and Run the following:
```sh
cd src/joemat
make
```
This produces a library file in `bin/`, either `bin/libjoemat.dylib` or `bin/libjoemat.so`.

Next, navigate to the project directory and run `generateInterfaceDefinition.m`.
It may be necessary to change the definition of `libFile` to
```m
libFile = "bin/libjoemat.so";
```
to match the path of the library file.

Open `definejoemat.m`. Uncomment the commented library definitions
and replace every instance of `<MLTYPE>` with `"string"`
and of `<SHAPE>` with `"nullTerminated"`.

In MATLAB, run `build(definejoemat)` to produce the interface file
`joemat/joematInterface.dylib`.

## Installing
Ensure `joematInterface.dylib` is in one of the directories in
the MATLAB path. To do this temporarily, run the command
```m
addPath("path/to/joemat-interface/joemat")
```
Next, add `mlfunctions/` to the MATLAB path.

## Usage
Fix a dimension n and denote the type `matrixSeq` corresponding to
horizontal MATLAB arrays consisting of n-by-n MATLAB matrices.
The following four functions are available:

* `getLieAlgebraBasis(matrixSeq generators) -> matrixSeq`
* `getLieAlgebraDim(matrixSeq generators) -> int`
* `getLieAlgebraCentralizer(matrixSeq generators) -> matrixSeq`
* `getLieAlgebraNormalizer(matrixSeq generators) -> matrixSeq`

In each case above, `generators` is a collection of generators
for the Lie algebra for which one wishes to compute the
relevant invariant, e.g., `getLieAlgebraBasis` will return
a basis for the algebra generated by `generators`,
and `getLieAlgebraNormalizer` will return
a basis for the normalizer of the algebra generated by `generators`.
